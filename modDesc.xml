Challenge: Can you survive playing with _only mods_ and nothing from the basegame?

Removing base-game vehicles, tools & placeables creates an interesting gameplay restriction that may change how you look at your gameplay.

This mod will remove all base-game vehicles, tools & placeables from the store. Those items are still there in the game, and if they already exist in a save, you will not lose anything... you just won't be able to buy / place anything from the base-game once the mod is enabled.
