# FS25 Mods Only
Challenge: Can you survive playing with _only mods_ and nothing from the basegame?

It's entirely possible, and creates not only a reliance on the modding community, but it creates some interesting gameplay restrictions that may change how you look at your gameplay.

This mod will remove all base-game vehicles, tools & placeables from the store. Those items are still there in the game, and if they already exist in a save, you will not lose anything... you just won't be able to buy / place anything from the base-game once the mod is enabled.

## Square by Modded Square Challenge

This mod is the core of a challenge that I'm proposing, called the **Square by Modded Square Challenge**, which has the following simple rules:

_Start:_
- Start in _Start from scratch_ mode on a modded map of your choosing
- Purchase a sub-200hp tractor, trailer, and chainsaw
- Purchase a single plot of land
- Reset your bank balance to $0 (no loan, unless you want the additional challenge)

_Rules:_
- Use nothing from the base-game, only mods.
- Contracts / Borrowing is only time when base-game equipment is allowed.
- Leasing is limited to 2 items at a time, and limited to a duration of 2 months.
- All other settings are player choice.

_Goal:_
- Own the map by progressing from your starting plot outwards, only purchasing farmland adjacent to farmland you currently own.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub on the releases page, save the `FS25_ModsOnly.zip` into your mod folder.
2. Launch the game, and activate the mod.

_Enjoy!_
