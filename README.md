# FS25 Mods Only
Challenge: Can you survive playing with _only mods_ and nothing from the basegame?

It's entirely possible, and creates not only a reliance on the modding community, but it creates some interesting gameplay restrictions that may change how you look at your gameplay.

This mod will remove all base-game vehicles, tools & placeables from the store. Those items are still there in the game, and if they already exist in a save, you will not lose anything... you just won't be able to buy / place anything from the base-game once the mod is enabled.

New farmer vehicles and vehicles as part of contracts will still spawn as normal, but you won't be able to purchase those same vehicles in the store.

## Square by Modded Square Challenge

This mod is the core of a challenge that I'm proposing, called the **Square by Modded Square Challenge**, which has the following simple rules:

_Start:_
- Start in _Start from scratch_ mode on a modded map of your choosing
- Purchase a sub-200hp tractor, trailer, and chainsaw
- Purchase a single plot of land
- Reset your bank balance to $0 (no loan, unless you want the additional challenge)

_Rules:_
- Use nothing from the base-game, only mods.
- Contracts / Borrowing is only time when base-game equipment is allowed.
- Leasing is limited to 2 items at a time, and limited to a duration of 2 months.
- All other settings are player choice.

_Goal:_
- Own the map by progressing from your starting plot outwards, only purchasing farmland adjacent to farmland you currently own.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub on the releases page, save the `FS25_ModsOnly.zip` into your mod folder.
2. Launch the game, and activate the mod.

_Enjoy!_
